This is my final project for the course, Introduction to Programming (II).

I created a 2D game which allows two players to controll characters to fight with each other by throwing water ball.

You should open the project by Qt 5.6.0.

Almost all the images were from Crazy Arcade, which is a popular game in Taiwan.

Feel free to reuse the code, but all the images is provided for only non-commercial purposes.
